                 <p  class="section-dname">Who Made Fallout: New Vegas?</p>

                 <p class="section-info">Fallout: New Vegas is a critically acclaimed role-playing game developed by <strong>Obsidian Entertainment</strong>and published by <strong>Bethesda Softworks</strong>. Released in 2010, the game is set in a post-apocalyptic world and is the fourth main installment in the Fallout series. 
                  In this article, we’ll delve into the history of the game’s development and explore the key players involved.</p>

                 <p  class="section-dname">The Concept and Development</p>

                 <p class="section-info">Fallout: New Vegas was conceived by <strong>Obsidian Entertainment</strong>, a studio founded in 2003 by a group of veteran game developers, including <strong>Feargus Urquhart</strong>,<strong>Chris Avellone</strong> and <strong>Chris Parker</strong>. 
                    The studio had previously worked on several notable games, including <a class="source-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_II:_The_Sith_Lords">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II</a> and <a  class="source-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neverwinter_Nights_2">Neverwinter Nights 2</a>.
                    In 2008, Obsidian Entertainment began working on Fallout: New Vegas, with a team of around 100 developers. The game was initially intended to be a spin-off, rather than a full-fledged sequel to the previous Fallout games. The team drew inspiration from the original Fallout games, as well as other classic RPGs, such as  <a class="source-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate">Baldur’s Gate</a> and  <a class="source-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planescape:_Torment">Planescape: Torment</a>.</p>

                               "Life Has A Way Of Punishing You For The Mistakes You Make."-<strong>Boone</strong>
                           </blockquote>

                           <p class="section-info"><strong>Personal opinion:</strong> Boon is one of many companions in the game with an equally tragic story. He lost his wife and unborn child in a single moment. He could have been a happy man with a family, but the harsh world of the desert spares few and leaves even fewer alive. To avoid spoiling the entire story arc with this character, it’s better for those reading this to experience this moment in the game themselves so as not to lose interest in the character and to better appreciate his story. In real life, his expression carries significant meaning as well, since life truly punishes a person for certain mistakes, especially for choices made by the individual, as some mistakes carry great significance and leave scars in a person’s life that they remember until the end of their days.</p>

                               </blockquote>

                                <p class="section-info"><strong>Personal opinion</strong>: Joshua Graham, also known as the Burned Man and formerly known as the Malpais Legate, is a Mormon missionary from the settlement of New Canaan and a co-founder of Caesar's Legion as well as its first legate.His past is filled with blood and brutality, he was betrayed, he is not who he used to be. To avoid fully spoiling this character's past and story, it is recommended that readers experience this character's story arc themselves.The character himself does not hide that he is a man of faith, but he justifies killing enemies as one of the ways to achieve peace. People cannot rely on faith for help in such matters, because there are things that simple belief in higher powers cannot resolve. This ideology is somewhat hypocritical, which is why he hints that one should not expect God to do all the work.</p>

                               </blockquote>

                                <p class="section-info"><strong>Personal opinion</strong>: Benny serves as the secondary antagonist of Fallout: New Vegas.To avoid revealing details of the questline with this character, it is recommended that the reader experience it on their own. He appears suddenly and disappears just as unexpectedly, reappearing again after some time during the game. In short, he is a very sneaky and slippery type who, at the beginning of the game, seems to address the player personally, saying that this whole game was planned from the very beginning in the hope of never encountering the main character again. This very phrase hints that the main character has become involved in something bigger than just gang disputes, helping residents, and seeking revenge.</p>

                        <p class="section-info">This was just an opinion about these three specific characters and their lines from the world of Fallout: New Vegas, since these three characters seemed the most interesting to me. The game has quite a lot of interesting characters and quests associated with them, each with their own views on things, their own philosophy, and this is what makes the game world so fascinating.</p>

                     <p class="section-info">Even after 16 years, Fallout: New Vegas remains a benchmark of the genre. People still enjoy playing it today, with some replaying it to explore new, undiscovered possibilities, as well as using it as a source of inspiration when creating their own games. An example is <a class="source-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outer_Worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> series, which adopted the best aspects of the role-playing system and the game's immersive atmosphere.<a class="source-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> also, although mostly futuristic, shows elements of choice, non-linearity, and a rich world inspired by New Vegas. In the future, Fallout: New Vegas will continue to serve as a model for some game developers and as a beloved game for replaying.</p>
